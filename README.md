# Gmail Triage CLI

A simple command-line tool for quickly triaging unread Gmail messages.

## Setup

### Google Cloud setup

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable the Gmail API:
   - Go to "APIs & Services" > "Library"
   - Search for "Gmail API" and enable it
4. Create credentials:
   - Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
   - Click "Create Credentials" > "OAuth client ID"
   - Choose "Desktop application"
   - Download the JSON file; save as `credentials.json` in the project root

### Build and run

```sh
go mod init gmail-triage
go mod tidy

go build -o gmail-triage
./gmail-triage
```

### First run

On first run, the app will:

1. Open your browser for Gmail authorization
2. Save your OAuth token to `token.json`
3. Start showing your unread messages

## Usage

The CLI will show each unread message with:

- Sender
- Subject line
- Preview snippet

For each message, choose:

- `r` - Mark as read
- `d` - Delete the message
- `s` - Mark as spam
- `p` - Pass (skip, do nothing)
- `q` - Quit the program

## Security Notes

- Keep `credentials.json` and `token.json` private
- Add them to `.gitignore` if using version control
- The OAuth token will refresh automatically when needed

## TODO

1. **Test OAuth flow** - Make sure authentication works end-to-end
2. **Error handling** - Add better error handling throughout
3. **Rate limiting** - Add delays between API calls if needed
4. **Batch operations** - Consider batching actions for better performance
5. **Configuration** - Add config file for preferences (max messages, etc.)
6. **Enhanced display** - Maybe add colors or better formatting
7. **Undo functionality** - Cache recent actions in case of mistakes

## API Limits

The Gmail API allows:

- 250 quota units per user per second
- Most operations cost 1â€“5 units
- Should be fine for personal use

The current implementation fetches up to 50 unread messages at once.
